        You need to write a loop that would consistently be going over the dictionary with the sailors and send them to one of the two ships, depending on the age.
The official <a href='https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict'>Python documentation</a> can help you understand how to work with dictionaries.

        Can you give an example of the code?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        The loop and the condition of sailors assignment will look like this:
        <pre class="brush: python">
for i in sailors.keys():
    if sailors[i] > 40 or sailors[i] < 20:
        #send sailor to the first ship
    else:
        #send sailor to the second ship
        </pre>
    </div>

        How do I appoint each particular sailor to the desired ship? 
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You can create 2 lists before a loop - first_ship and second_ship, and use an <a href='https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists'>append</a> method to add sailors to the needed list.

        In combination with the previous part of the solution, it’ll look like this:
        <pre class="brush: python">
first_ship = []
second_ship = []

for i in sailors.keys():
    if sailors[i] > 40 or sailors[i] < 20:
        first_ship.append(i)
    else:
        second_ship.append(i)
        </pre>
    </div>

        But the sailors names on the list go randomly. How can I sort them?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You can sort them by using the <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted'>sorted() function</a> or the sort() method, which is described in the <a href='https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists'>catalog of available methods</a> for the data structure - list.
