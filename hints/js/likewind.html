        You need to write a loop that would consistently be going over the dictionary with the sailors and send them to one of the two ships, depending on the age.

        Can you give an example of the code?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        The loop and the condition of sailors assignment will look like this:
        <pre class="brush: javascript">
    for (let name in sailors) {
        if (sailors[name] < 20 || sailors[name] > 40) {
            //send sailor to the first ship
        } else {
            //send sailor to the second ship
        }
    }
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        How do I appoint each particular sailor to the desired ship? 
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You can create 2 lists before a loop - first_ship and second_ship, and use a push() method to add sailors to the needed list.

        In combination with the previous part of the solution, it’ll look like this:
        <pre class="brush: javascript">
    let first = [], second = [];
    for (let name in sailors) {
        if (sailors[name] < 20 || sailors[name] > 40) {
            first.push(name);
        } else {
            second.push(name);
        }
    }
        </pre>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        But the sailors names on the list go randomly. How can I sort them?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You can sort them by using the sort() method.
