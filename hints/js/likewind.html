        I don’t know how to start solving this mission.

    <div class="answer">
        You need to write a loop that would consistently be going over the dictionary with the sailors and send them to one of the two ships, depending on the age.

    <div class="question">
        Can you give an example of the code?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        The loop and the condition of sailors assignment will look like this:
        <pre class="brush: javascript">
    var sailor_names = Object.keys(sailors);
    var i;
    for (i=0; i<sailor_names.length; i++){
        if (sailors[sailor_names[i]] > 40 || sailors[sailor_names[i]] < 20){
            //send sailor to the first ship
        }
        else {
            //send sailor to the second ship
        }
    }
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        How do I appoint each particular sailor to the desired ship? 
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You can create 2 lists before a loop - first_ship and second_ship, and use a push() method to add sailors to the needed list.

        In combination with the previous part of the solution, it’ll look like this:
        <pre class="brush: javascript">
    var first_ship = [];
    var second_ship = [];
    var sailor_names = Object.keys(sailors);
    var i;
    for (i=0; i<sailor_names.length; i++){
        if (sailors[sailor_names[i]] > 40 || sailors[sailor_names[i]] < 20){
            first_ship.push(sailor_names[i]);
        }
        else {
            second_ship.push(sailor_names[i]);
        }
    }
        </pre>
    </div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        But the sailors names on the list go randomly. How can I sort them?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You can sort them by using the sort() method.
